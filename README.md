# SQL_Deforestation_Project

ForestQuery, a non-profit organization on a mission to reduce deforestation around the world and which raises awareness about this important environmental topic.

They are looking to understand which countries and regions around the world seem to have forests that have been shrinking in size, and also which countries and regions have the most significant forest area, both in terms of amount and percent of total area. 

The data analysis team at ForestQuery has obtained data from the World Bank that includes forest area and total land area by country and year from 1990 to 2016, as well as a table of countries and the regions to which they belong.

I downloaded data from Udacity project. I prepared and disseminated a report for the project that helped them to understand the global deforestation overview between 1990 and 2016.
